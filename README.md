# Shiny App COVID-19 Lockdown Overview

This Shiny app provides an interactive overview of how countries lift the lockdown brought about by the novel coronavirus. The app uses the [Oxford Stringency Index](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/about-api) and the death counts provided by [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
