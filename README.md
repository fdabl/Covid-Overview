# Interactive Exploration of COVID-19 Spread and Measures
This Shiny app provides an interactive overview of the effect of the novel coronavirus across countries, and what measures those countries have taken to combat it. The app uses the [*covid19* R package](https://covid19datahub.io/) as a source of data for confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, and the [Oxford Stringency Index](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/about-api).
